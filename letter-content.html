Hie Anjula,
</p>

<p class="mt-4">
They say that the finest stories are never truly written; they are lived, breath by breath, in the quiet spaces between two people. As I sit here trying to capture the gravity of what I feel, I realized that a simple message could never contain it. It needed a sanctuary-a digital parchment where time slows down, just like it does when I am with you.
</p>

<p class="mt-4">
There is a specific kind of alchemy that happens the moment we are in the same room. The world outside, with all its noise, its frantic pace, and its sharp edges, seems to lose its power. When I am with you, I feel a sense of groundedness that I haven't found anywhere else. It isn't just that you are kind or that you listen; it's the way your energy settles mine. You are my favorite kind of silence and my most cherished conversation. Whether we are sharing a laugh that leaves us breathless or sitting in a comfortable quiet, I feel an overwhelming sense of "home." It is a rare gift to find someone who makes the present moment feel like exactly where you are supposed to be.
</p>

<p class="mt-4">
But the magic doesn't end when we part ways. Even in the spaces between our meetings, you have this incredible way of reaching through the distance. I want you to know a secret: there is a distinct, rhythmic skip my heart takes every single time your name illuminates my screen. In a world of endless notifications and digital clutter, your text is the only one that carries weight. It's a spark of electricity-a sudden, warm glow that tells me I am thought of by the person I think of most.
</p>

<p class="mt-4">
Whether it is a simple "hello," a shared joke, or a long story about your day, seeing your name pop up is the highlight of my waking hours. It's more than just a message; it's a bridge. It's a reminder that even when the day is heavy, there is a light waiting for me at the other end of a signal. I find myself smiling at my phone like a fool, oblivious to the world around me, because in that moment, it's just us.
</p>

<p class="mt-4">
Anjula, you have become the melody to my daily rhythm. I built this space-this digital "old-school" letter-because something as special as you deserves more than a temporary chat bubble. You deserve the permanence of a story. You are the grace in my chaos, the clarity in my confusion, and the person who makes every tomorrow look a little brighter.
</p>

<p class="mt-4">
As you read this, know that every word is etched with sincerity. You aren't just a part of my life; you are the part that makes the rest of it make sense.
</p>

<p class="mt-4">
With all that I am,
</p>

<p class="mt-4">
Adi
</p>
